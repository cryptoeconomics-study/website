This introduction aims to define cryptoeconomics, outline some tools for the design and analysis of cryptoeconomic systems, and study the mechanism design within bitcoin at a high level. The goal is to present a sample of what may be taught, to whet the appetite for further study.
Cryptoeconomics is a nascent field. The reader should be aware that the glossary is still being developed, and that some terminologies and concepts are still in flux and subject to change and evolution over time.

Cryptoeconomics encompasses a toolbox that we can utilize to determine the security of information in a system. Cryptographic tools allow us to prove characteristics about the past and both cryptographic and economic tools allow us to assert characteristics about the future. Cryptoeconomics is like mechanism design in that it starts with the desired end goal and works backwards to find the right set of mechanisms to align incentives of all participants in the system towards that common goal.
