# Ch2.3 Overview 

Latency-Based Consensus
- create an upper bound on network latency and only process valid transactions which are received within that timespan (should provide enough time for all honest participants to receive and process any message under normal network conditions)
- only process transactions that are signed by all network participants (nodes)
